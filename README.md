Homekit Infused v3.0.0 Framework

Placeholder!

This is the Homekit Infused 3.0.0 framework, this is only the framework and will contain unfilled views. You will need to install this first!
After the installation of the framework you can go on to install the addons (or create your own cards), the addons will decide the looks and layout of your installation.
All the cards that were previously included in HKI are now all downloadable separately.

Requirements:
  - You MUST have installed all the addons and requirements that are found in the HKI documentation! Most if not ALL addons require them and future addons will definitely require some of them.
  - You MUST make a backup of your old installation, especially when you are upgrading this will be a good thing to do since many paths/names have changed and you're probably better off putting back your code slowly.
  - You MUST make sure that you do NOT have any leftovers from other themes (e.g. DwainsTheme) as they will most likely conflict.

Please refer to the addons documentation on how to create your own layout with predefined HKI cards or how to create your own. Each card will have a detailed explanation on how to install.
