This will fix popups not working with button-cards.

For some reason you can no longer download this version through HACS. Download button-card first through HACS.
Once you are done, go to your `/www/community/button-card/` folder and replace the two files there with the two from this repo.

You might need to change your permissions to this folder to be able to write in there.

For Unraid users you can do something like this (change the path to match your own)

`chmod 777 -R /mnt/user/appdata/Home-Assistant/www/community/button-card`
