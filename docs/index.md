# About this project
Homekit Infused is a Home Assistant lovelace project designed to mimic, improve and ultimately replace Homekit. Homekit has too much limitations which I think was too bad as it really looks cool if you only have 6 lights :D

Homekit Infused was created as a private project and released to the public as it was requested by many. In the past year the setup has changed quite a bit, not only aesthetically but also codewise. My goal was to make it easier for people to use what I have created without compromising too much on customization that users have made after installing my previous versions of HKI. The setup is still just as 'modular' as it ever was and you will find many improvements over the previous versions if you are an avid user of my setup. New users might find this project very interesting as well, as not only does it give you this wonderful interface, but it will also give you insight on how a bartender (yes that is me) creates code without having any coding knowledge beforehand other than some basic HTML back in the early 2000s.

# Warnings!!!!
Warning:
  - This project is NOT for beginners, if you do not know the basics of lovelace, you probably shouldn't jump on installing this project too fast (however, it is easier to install/configure than ever). If you don't have the basic knowledge, don't want to learn lovelace or simply want to wait installing this project to get more knowledge about lovelace then I can recommend you to use apps like HassKit or HassApp (they are both free!). These apps are really really easy to use and even looks good. However it isn't that much customizable and well it has a different style to them (even though it is only a slight difference).
  
  - People coming from HKI 0.13.3 or below I have some bad news, there is NO upgrade path from those versions. You will have to install it fresh (you probably still want to as this code is imho much much better).
