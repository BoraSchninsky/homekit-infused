# About Homekit Infused
Homekit Infused v2.0.0 is the craziest lovelace setup out there in YAML mode. It is 90% configurable through the Homekit Infused interface! The other 10% is still super easy to setup. Your views will be auto-filled with your own entities and all you'd need to do is set up a single file! But WAIT!!!!! There is more..........

Homekit Infused has a fully customizable UI, you can create your own frontpage layout with ease with the built-in edit mode which allows you to show/hide and add elements to the UI with a flick of a button. Most of the configuration can be done within the HKI Settings and changes done within the UI are INSTANT!!! Yes you've read it well, no restarts or lovelace refreshes required!

Homekit Infused was created as a private project and released to the public as it was requested by many. In the past year the setup has changed quite a bit, not only aesthetically but also codewise. My goal was to make it easier for people to use what I have created without compromising too much on customization that users have made after installing my previous versions of HKI. The setup is still just as 'modular' as it ever was and you will find many improvements over the previous versions if you are an avid user of my setup. New users might find this project very interesting as well, as not only does it give you this wonderful interface, but it will also give you insight on how a bartender (yes that is me) creates code without having any coding knowledge beforehand other than some basic HTML back in the early 2000s.

# Warnings!!!!
Warning:
- This lovelace UI is pretty heavy and it is not recommended to run this on a raspberry pi! Minimum requirements would be to use at least a NUC with an i3, 2GB of RAM and preferably more than 1.8Ghz. Better hardware will result in better performance! You can ofcourse proceed and install this on a rpi anyway if you really want to try it (though please share your results with me if you do so as I don't have one and I can't test it)
- People coming from HKI 1.1 please read the notes [HERE](https://jimz011.github.io/updates)
- Questions asked without reading the documentation have the chance of not being answered. Read before you need help! I will however post video's on YT in the future
- Using HKI means you MUST have lovelace in YAML mode, what this means is that you can NO LONGER use the UI editor within lovelace. Therefor all the options to do that have been removed. Do NOT try to edit it with the GUI anyways as it will simply not work. If you rely on that specific editor this project is NOT for you! However HKI does have a replacement that basically does pretty much the same thing!
- If you use the NEST integration, you probably do NOT want to do a clean install! You might not be able to restore it. This is only a warning! I do not own a NEST and I have no clue on how it works. I mention this advised by some of the followers of this project.
