## Common Installation Issues

* There are 2 methods of installation: Manually or with HACS. Follow only one of these methods.
* If this is your first custom add-on to HA or first time using the /www/ folder, restart after install.
* Make sure you're using the [raw file from GitHub](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-config/wiki/Lovelace-Plugins#2-download-the-plugin).

[@thomasloven's lovelace guide](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-config/wiki/Lovelace-Plugins) is a great resource for and intro to custom Lovelace plugins.
