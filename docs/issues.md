## ISSUES
If there are any issues please report them via GitHub. When doing so please be thorough in your explanation as the more details the better. Saying things like, "I have an issue, my lights view wont show" is not a good issue explanation as I will still be completely clueless as to why it won't show for you. Issues like these will be closed without an answer!
You could also quickly open a bug report by going inside of the HKI Menu > About > Bug Report.

The docs might be incomplete or not completely comprehensible for all. Remember that I am alone in this project, that I am not a programmer and that working on this for so long might get me into forgetting to add something in here. If you find something that is missing or incomplete please notify me so that I can change the documentation.

#### Known Issues
  - Sometimes notifications would suddenly stop scrolling, solution is to touch the notification slightly, it will go back to automatic scrolling if you do that. I can't and wont fix this as it is a non-issue.
  - Some themes require extra tweaking, if you feel like you can help you can always do a PR
  - The navigation bars extra options to show user/date or time is currently not working. The status of this is unknown.
