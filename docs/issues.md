# ISSUES
If there are any issues please report them via GitHub. When doing so please be thorough in your explanation as the more details the better.
Saying things like, "I have an issue, my lights view wont show" is not a good issue explanation as I will still be completely clueless as to why it won't show for you. Issues like these will be closed without an answer!
The docs might be incomplete or not completely comprehensible for all. Remember that I am alone in this project, that I am not a programmer and that working on this for so long might get me into forgetting to add something in here. If you find something that is missing or incomplete please notify me so that I can change the documentation.

### Known Issues
  - Sometimes the HA app reloads after going to another tab (seems this is being worked on by the HA team)
  - Sometimes icons will not show the template when using Custom-UI, solution is a refresh
  - HACS doesn't always load after a restart, solution is to restart again (I do not know if this is since the last update of HACS or if something else is causing it)
  - Entities card takes more time to load than others (this seems to me like a card-mod problem as it only does it with entities cards, even with a single line config it would still do this)
  - Sometimes notifications would suddenly stop scrolling, solution is to touch the notification slightly, it will go back to automatic scrolling if you do that. I can't and wont fix this as it is a non-issue
