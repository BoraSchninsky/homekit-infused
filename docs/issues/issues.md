## Issues

#### Before posting an issue:

- Be sure to read the [important notes section](#intro/notes) of the Docs.
- Disable Custom Header by temporarily removing it from your resouces to see if the issue persists. If it does, it's likely Custom Header is not the culprit.
- Issues should be posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/maykar/custom-header/issues/new/choose) and preferably not on the forums. This makes tracking the issues easier and they will be resolved quicker.
- Search [GitHub issues](https://github.com/maykar/custom-header/issues?q=is%3Aissue) (open and closed) as well as the forums to see if your issue has already been posted.

#### Provide as much of the following info as possible:

- A copy/paste of your Custom Header config
- Any errors relevant to Custom Header found in the HA logs
- Any relevant errors found in your browsers dev console (usually found by hitting F12)
- The version of Home Assistant and Custom Header you are using
- The browser type your are using

When pasting in your config always place 3 backticks ` ``` ` above the first line and after the last line. Doing this will format it correctly so that I can find any errors in your config.

Issues that don't provide the necessary information may not get a reply and may be closed.
