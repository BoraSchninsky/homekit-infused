# IMPORTANT NOTES
First of all I want to thank you all for your patience and support, it really means a lot to me. Though I do want to ask you to help each other out as well and not spam me constantly with support questions.
Remember I am only a bartender and I am not a programmer, nor do I have the experience or time to know everything XD.
- Creating updates for a project like this without any programming knowledge is hard, but I will try to make it as painless as possible.
- Future releases will probably not deviate too much from the current design and will probably only hold bugfixes, component/plugin updates and ofcourse new views and themes!
- Installing this means you accept the risks that may occur. I cannot be held responsible for any damage/loss you suffered by installing this (obviously this will never occur if you make backups!)
- Questions asked without reading the documentation have the chance of not being answered. Read before you need help! I will however post video's on YT in the future
- If you use the NEST integration, you probably do NOT want to do a clean install! You might not be able to restore it. This is only a warning! I do not own a NEST and I have no clue on how it works. I mention this advised by some of the followers of this project.
- Using HKI means you MUST have lovelace in YAML mode, what this means is that you can NO LONGER use the UI editor within lovelace. Therefor all the options to do that have been removed. Do NOT try to edit it with the GUI anyways as it will simply not work. If you rely on that specific editor this project is NOT for you!
