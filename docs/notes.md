# IMPORTANT NOTES
First of all I want to thank you all for your patience and support, it really means a lot to me. Though I do want to ask you to help each other out as well and not spam me constantly with support questions.
Remember I am only a bartender and I am not a programmer, nor do I have the experience or time to know everything XD.
  - I do not guarantee this setup will work for you
  - The setup has only been tested on an iPhone X (though it should not work differently on other smartphones)
  - I am trying to make updates as easy as possible hence all the templates and global config. Though it could still occur that I need to update a file that you have edited. I will create a guide for those specific files if it would ever be needed.
  - Future releases will probably not deviate too much from the current design and will probably only hold bugfixes, component/plugin updates and ofcourse new views and themes!
  - Installing this means you accept the risks that may occur. I cannot be held responsible for any damage/loss you suffered by installing this (obviously this will never occur)
  - Questions asked without reading the documentation have the chance to not being answered. Read before you need (help)! I will however post video's on YT in the future
