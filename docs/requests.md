# FEATURE REQUESTS
If you think there are features missing or that I should really implement a new feature/view please open an issue on GitHub with the title `FR` or `Feature Request`. In the comment field please state what features you would want to see,
and motivate your answer. Tell me why you think I should add it and what benefits it would have for other users. I will not create personal requests that would only suit a single user as that would be madness!

### Current Feature Requests
  - Afvalbeheer Card (this was actually in 0.13.3 but removed for the 1.0a version as the widgets page has been removed, it will return soon)
  - P2000 (requested some months ago, though not sure if it will make the cut)
  - Flight Information (currently there are no known components/addons that can do this, I will add this if this ever comes)
  - News (seems a bit too heavy for Home Assistant to have this running all the time, but I will look into it)
  
### To Do
  - Fix themes (some themes need tweaking)
  - Add themes
  - Add new views (for example garden/plant view)
  - Rework scenes for use with the latest Home Assistant
  - Computer/Server monitor view
  - Other stuff?!
