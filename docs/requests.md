# FEATURE REQUESTS
If you think there are features missing or that I should really implement a new feature/view please open an issue on GitHub with the title `FR` or `Feature Request`. In the comment field please state what features you would want to see,
and motivate your answer. You could also simply go inside of the HKI menu and click on About > Feature Request.

Tell me why you think I should add it and what benefits it would have for other users. I will not create personal requests that would only suit a single user as that would be madness!

### Current Feature Requests
  - Afvalbeheer Card (this was actually in 0.13.3 but removed for the 1.0a version as the widgets page has been removed, it will return soon)
  - P2000 (requested some months ago, though not sure if it will make the cut)
  - Flight Information (currently there are no known components/addons that can do this, I will add this if this ever comes)
  - News (seems a bit too heavy for Home Assistant to have this running all the time, but I will look into it)
  - The power usage label in the buttons which was present pre HKI 1.0 will make its return if I find a way to get it to work with auto-entities. This will come soon!
  
### To Do
  - Tweak some themes here and there
  - Add themes
  - Add new views as addons
  - Rework scenes for use with the latest Home Assistant
  - Bug fixes (if any)
  - Other stuff
