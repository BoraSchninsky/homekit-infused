# FEATURE REQUESTS
If you think there are features missing or that I should really implement a new feature/view please open an issue on GitHub with the title `FR` or `Feature Request`. In the comment field please state what features you would want to see,
and motivate your answer. You could also simply go inside of the HKI menu and click on About > Feature Request.

Tell me why you think I should add it and what benefits it would have for other users. I will not create personal requests that would only suit a single user as that would be madness!

### To Do
  - Tweak some themes here and there
  - Add themes
  - Add new views as addons
  - Rework scenes for use with the latest Home Assistant
  - Bug fixes (if any)
  - Other stuff
