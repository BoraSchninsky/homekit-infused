# TIPS & TRICKS
This page will contain tutorials, tips and tricks on how to edit certain views, cards, elements and more for Homekit Infused. Unfortunately this will take time to write and will stay under construction for the time being.
If you want to help, please help me write tutorials on how you have edited Homekit Infused in a way that others might understand. Press on issues on Github and open a request for adding a tutorial. Tutorials that are unreadable to the average user will not be accepted.
I thank all of you in advance for sharing your tips and tricks for Homekit Infused here to not only help me getting better documentation (and less support questions) but also all of the users that would love to share configs.
Sharing a tutorial, trick or tip here with us will give it a better place than on the HA forums as it will fade away into the background because of all the messages. Info will always stand out here and thus easier to find for new and existing users.
Thanks again for sharing your experiences.
