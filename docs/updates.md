# Updates and Addons
## Updates
When you don't edit any of the views, includes and templates you can easily update this install! All you would need to do is copy my new files over your old ones. Each update will have some kind of instructions on how to update. Some are very small or easy, some require a bit more work. I will always try to make the transition as smooth as possible.

## Addons
Check out the following repositories to find some great ideas and addons for HKI
