# Updates and Addons
## Updates
When you don't edit any of the views, includes and templates you can easily update this install! All you would need to do is copy my new files over your old ones.

## Addons
This project will get addons in the form of new views and/or widgets.
If you like to create addons for this project and want to share them, please learn how to use the Config Template Card and/or how to template button-card for use with HKI (you can find examples when inspecting my views, just don't edit them ok?).
