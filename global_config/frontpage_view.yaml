# Global Config for Homekit Infused v.1.0b January 2020

# IMPORTANT NOTE: Do NOT remove ANY of these lines, if you have less than what is in this file just leave those lines unedited unless you know what you are doing. Not following this very simple rule might
# cause errors which results in a frontend that no longer loads (and trust me it is not as easy to find lovelace_gen problems than core problems!). You can however add stuff (if you know what you are doing ofc)!
# I highly (and I really mean HIGHLY) recommend you to read up on the following site as most of this setup is made with this! https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-lovelace_gen. It looks pretty technical but to get
# most out of Homekit Infused you will have to understand how it is made. If this all sounds too difficult? No worries, simply continue on and edit this file and remember NO DELETING OF LINES!!!!!

# Before you continue I will recommend you to use VSCode as a text editor https://code.visualstudio.com/

# You do NOT have to have all entities, though it would certainly help if you did. Each entity that can be created without the need to buy extra devices will have a link for how to create one.
# Sometimes you find stuff twice in this list (like person entities) This is done so that it is slightly clearer what you are actually doing, you can simple select the entity and press ctrl+d (vscode/sublime)
# and change all the related entities at once.

# Frontpage Config
frontpage:
  ## Weather
  - Eindhoven # City Name
  - weather.dark_sky # Weather Entity (for best results you should have this, if you don't have one create one easily with the darksky sensor https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/weather.darksky/)
  ## Left Photo
  - person.stephanie # Person 1 Entity Left Photo (create a person entity, do not use device_trackers directly, but add them to a person entity and use the person entity here!)
  - /local/images/stephanie_small.png # Location File Person 1 Left Photo
  - sensor.email_sensor_stephanie # Email Sensor Person 1 (for best results you should have this, find an email integration for your own use https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/imap/)
  - sensor.reistijd_stephanie # Travel Time to Home Sensor Person 1 (for best results you should have this, use the waze sensor to do this https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/waze_travel_time/)
  - sensor.reistijd_stephanie_work # Travel Time to Work Sensor Person 1 (for best results you should have this, use the waze sensor to do this https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/waze_travel_time/)
  - sensor.battery_level # Smartphone Battery Level Sensor Person 1 (for best results you should have this, installing the offical HA app on either iOS or Android should be sufficient to get these sensors)
  ## Right Photo
  - person.jimmy # Person 2 Entity Right Photo
  - /local/images/jimmy_small.png # Location File Person 2 Right Photo
  - sensor.email_sensor_jimmy # Email Sensor Person 2 (for best results you should have this, find an email integration for your own use https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/imap/)
  - sensor.reistijd_jimmy # Travel Time to Home Sensor Person 2 (for best results you should have this, use the waze sensor to do this https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/waze_travel_time/)
  - sensor.reistijd_jimmy_work # Travel Time to Work Sensor Person 2 (for best results you should have this, use the waze sensor to do this https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/waze_travel_time/)
  - sensor.battery_level_2 # Smartphone Battery Level Sensor Person 2 (for best results you should have this, installing the offical HA app on either iOS or Android should be sufficient to get these sensors)

  # The following 4 configuration options depend on either if you use the default setup with a photo in the middle or if you want to use the 4 persons large_small layout which can be found in the addons of my repo.
  ## Middle Left Photo (or middle photo when used with the default layout)
  - person.tala # Person 3 Entity Middle Photo
  - /local/images/tala2.png # Location File Person 3 Middle Photo
  ## Middle Right Photo (this is only used with the large_small frontpage layout! For 4 large photos use the four persons global_config addon found on my repo)
  - person.tala # Person 4 Entity Middle Photo
  - /local/images/tala2.png # Location File Person 3 Middle Photo

  # Continue from here if you had skipped the middle photos part!
  ## Alarm Entity
  - alarm_control_panel.home_alarm # Alarm Control Panel Entity (for best results you WANT this! it will work without it however creating a homemade alarm is super easy https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/manual/)
  ## Camera Entity
  - camera.gallerij_camera # Choose your most valuable camera when you are not at home as this will be displayed on the frontpage when all users are gone!

# Button config, the first row is hardcoded for the simple reason that they have a template sensor entity coded in them. If you want to rearrange those buttons anyway, you should edit the 00.frontpage.yaml file.
# You can however change the names and icons used on the frontpage all within this file!
# NOTE: Editing the frontpage.yaml file will make it impossible for you to update that file with my updates, only do this if you know your way around HA, else leave it at the defaults!
