# Global Config for Homekit Infused v.1.0b January 2020

# IMPORTANT NOTE: Do NOT remove ANY of these lines, if you have less than what is in this file just leave those lines unedited unless you know what you are doing. Not following this very simple rule might
# cause errors which results in a frontend that no longer loads (and trust me it is not as easy to find lovelace_gen problems than core problems!). You can however add stuff (if you know what you are doing ofc)!
# I highly (and I really mean HIGHLY) recommend you to read up on the following site as most of this setup is made with this! https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-lovelace_gen. It looks pretty technical but to get
# most out of Homekit Infused you will have to understand how it is made. If this all sounds too difficult? No worries, simply continue on and edit this file and remember NO DELETING OF LINES!!!!!

# Before you continue I will recommend you to use VSCode as a text editor https://code.visualstudio.com/

# You do NOT have to have all entities, though it would certainly help if you did. Each entity that can be created without the need to buy extra devices will have a link for how to create one.
# Sometimes you find stuff twice in this list (like person entities) This is done so that it is slightly clearer what you are actually doing, you can simple select the entity and press ctrl+d (vscode/sublime)
# and change all the related entities at once.

# Remote Control View (the current template only works with a remote.entity. This was specifically created for the Apple TV. I will publish other templates in the future)
remote:
  # Living Room
  ## First Row (On/Off Switches)
  - switch.samsung_tv # Livingroom TV entity (switches are preferred as they work better with button-card! See my template switches for examples on how to do this!)
  - switch.receiver # Livingroom Audio Receiver entity (switches are preferred once again)
  ## Media Player and Remote
  - media_player.samsung_tv_ue65ku6000 # Livingroom Media Player Entity that controls the volume (this can be a receiver entity as well, as long as it is within the media_player domain)
  - media_player.woonkamer_apple_tv # Livingroom Media Player Entity to show in the mini-media-player card (in my case it is an Apple TV)
  - remote.woonkamer_apple_tv # Livingroom Remote Entity for controlling the actual remote (this can be a TV for example or in my case an Apple TV)
  # Bedroom
  ## First Row (On/Off Switches)
  - switch.tv_slaapkamer # Bedroom TV entity (switches are preferred as they work better with button-card! See my template switches for examples on how to do this!)
  - switch.receiver_slaapkamer # Bedroom Audio Receiver entity (switches are preferred once again)
  ## Media PLayer and Remote
  - media_player.samsung_tv_ue46es5500 # Bedroom Media Player Entity that controls the volume (this can be a receiver entity as well, as long as it is within the media_player domain)
  - media_player.slaapkamer_apple_tv # Bedroom Media Player Entity to show in the mini-media-player card (in my case it is an Apple TV)
  - remote.slaapkamer_apple_tv # Bedroom Remote Entity for controlling the actual remote (this can be a TV for example or in my case an Apple TV)
