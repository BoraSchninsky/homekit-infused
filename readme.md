Please ask any question you have on the [HA Community Forums](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/homekit-infused-hki-v0-13-3/117086/1)

#### Featured Theme
Dwains Theme is a beautiful theme created by @Dwains which can be found [here](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/lovelace-dwains-theme). I will recommend this theme as an alternative to HKI when you are using lighter hardware.

#### Featured Cards and Addons
One of the great things that can be done with it is shown by the following user @noodlemctwoodle which has shared his beautiful view which can be used with HKI! You can find his repo and instructions [here](https://github.com/noodlemctwoodle/homeassistant)
