# Homekit Infused (Lovelace) by Jimz011 September 2020 v3.0.0 (*updated: 06/08/2020)
Latest working Home Assistant version is 0.112.4 (do not update past this number for best compatibility)

## Project currently unavailable! This will come back online soon, for older versions please click on one of the links below. Note that I will stop supporting v2.0.0 whenever I release v3.0.0. Users that were used to heavy loading will be pleased to know that these issues have all been addressed (it also means v3.0.0 will run on a pi!). See you soon!

Please ask any question you have on the [HA Community Forums](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/homekit-infused-hki-v0-13-3/117086/1)

#### Featured Theme
Dwains Theme is a beautiful theme created by @Dwains which can be found [here](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/lovelace-dwains-theme). I will recommend this theme as an alternative to HKI when you are using lighter hardware.

#### Featured Cards and Addons
One of the great things that can be done with it is shown by the following user @noodlemctwoodle which has shared his beautiful view which can be used with HKI! You can find his repo and instructions [here](https://github.com/noodlemctwoodle/homeassistant)
