## Homekit Infused (Lovelace) by Jimz011
This is Homekit Infused aka HKI. When you come here for the first time you might be a little confused to what this is. 
Homekit Infused is in a nutshell a customizable 'framework' that you can use to build your own dashboard on, it is preconfigured to have an Apple style to it.
By default it contains the following things:
- A beautiful header with notifications that is customizable per view and is added to each view for you automatically
- A customizable navigation bar which can also be set at the bottom of the screen 
- 11 color schemes
- A LOT of (optional) addons that can be turned on/off at will without any coding knowledge to enhance your lovelace experience
- Easy updates, copy/replace 2 folders on each update!
- And MUCH MUCH I mean MUCH more!

*Note: None of the custom-cards used in this project are made by me and every custom-card used has a reference to their original creators as well as the original link to their repo's. All contributors/donators and people that gave me the inspiration are mentioned in the docs on the last page!

### Featured Theme
Dwains Dashboard is a beautiful dashboard created by @Dwains which can be found [here](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/dwains-lovelace-dashboard). I will recommend this theme as an alternative to HKI when you are using lighter hardware.
