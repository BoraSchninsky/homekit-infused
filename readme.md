# Homekit Infused (Lovelace) by Jimz011 March 2020 v2.0.0 Beta 7 (*updated: 08/03/2020)
# WARNING: BETA Testers should NOT update to HA 0.107.x just yet, HKI is incompatible with it and it requires an update from one of the custom plugins used. Unfortunately this is out of my hands and all we can do is hope for a quick fix from the respective developer.

My current Home Assistant version is 0.106.6

## Coming Soon! (Closed beta will start at 08/03/2020) You can join our slack channel if you're interested in testing.

#### About
Homekit Infused v2.0.0 is the craziest lovelace setup out there in YAML mode. It is 90% configurable through the Homekit Infused interface! The other 10% is still super easy to setup. Your views will be auto-filled with your own entities and all you'd need to do is set up a single file! But WAIT!!!!! There is more..........

Homekit Infused has a fully customizable UI, you can create your own frontpage layout with ease with the built-in edit mode which allows you to show/hide and add elements to the UI with a flick of a button. Most of the configuration can be done within the HKI Settings and changes done within the UI are INSTANT!!! Yes you've read it well, no restarts or lovelace refreshes required!
