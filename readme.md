#### About
Homekit Infused v2.0.0 is the craziest lovelace setup out there in YAML mode. It is 90% configurable through the Homekit Infused interface! The other 10% is still super easy to setup. Your views will be auto-filled with your own entities and all you'd need to do is set up a single file! But WAIT!!!!! There is more..........

Homekit Infused has a fully customizable UI, you can create your own frontpage layout with ease with the built-in edit mode which allows you to show/hide and add elements to the UI with a flick of a button. Most of the configuration can be done within the HKI Settings and changes done within the UI are INSTANT!!! Yes you've read it well, no restarts or lovelace refreshes required!

#### Changes since 1.1
- Rewritten with a new UI based design
- Added widgets
- All views are now customizable with ease
- Separated HKI from user content (no more worrying about updates ever again)
- Added tons of layout options
- Added a lot of new content to the frontpage and menu which can be easily customized
- Added an edit mode which is used to change the layouts
- Added an HKI Settings menu in which you can configure anything from names to icons to the headers, subtitles and even several cards! Oh and did I mention that those changes are all instant and do not require any kind of refresh/restart?
- Added multiple new rooms (a total of 20 rooms is now available)
- Added multi floor layouts for lights and devices
- All previous elements of HKI (e.g. sensors at the top, header subtitle, and even the sensors in the photos on the frontpage) can now be shown/hidden at will with a button switch in the new edit mode
- Added a new about page where you can track HKI updates ask support or quickly open a feature request
- You now have a choice between 3 or 4 button rows on most views
- Global Config has been reduced in size and is now completely done within the UI. Some settings remain unfortunately
- Added Orange Delight color scheme
- Fixed Home Assistant color scheme
- Badges are now available to ALL frontpage and menu buttons and can be easily setup in the interface
- If you have Fontawesome Pro (html, not the component) you can easily switch to FA icons with a flip of a switch
- You can now easily switch between English or Dutch (more languages will be added in the future)
- You can now easily create widgets for HKI as widgets are essentially just cards (you can send me your ideas if you want me to merge your card into HKI)
- Fixed a lot of bugs (e.g. popups for lights, thermostat, devices etc)
- Notifications are now separate in the new /user_content/ folder
- Global Config has been renamed to extra_settings.yaml and is now in the /user_content/ folder
- Added a custom user area on each view!!! (adding cards to this area will survive any update, yay) The files for these areas can be found in the /user_content/ folder
- Added 4 custom views for you to setup which can be done in the interface, only the cards will have to be done in YAML
- Added 8 custom buttons for you to use. 4 of them to use with the custom views, the other 4 can be used to toggle any entity you want. These buttons can be set as a favorite in both the frontpage and menu.
- And lots and lots more!

Conclusion: Get v2.0.0 as soon as it is here, make the change if coming from older versions and never worry about updates again! You won't need to read an update guide ever again as you can simply update any time with ease. For updates to work you should NEVER touch the files in the /lovelace/ folder. You shouldn't need to edit them as you have your own custom user areas for that. If you want to customize an entire view, just turn off every element of that view with edit mode and turn on 'user content'. That's it folks, Enjoy!
