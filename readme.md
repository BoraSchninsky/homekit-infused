#### About
Homekit Infused v2.0.0 is the craziest lovelace setup out there in YAML mode. It is 95% configurable through the Homekit Infused interface! The other 5% is still super easy to setup and there is a chance you will never even have to touch these files (depending on your usecase). Views will be built when you fill in the HKI Settings, and there is a lot to setup, from names to icons, from layouts to fonts, from themes to border styles and much more!

Homekit Infused has a fully customizable UI, you can create your own frontpage layout with ease with the built-in edit mode which allows you to show/hide and add elements to the UI with a flick of a button. Most of the configuration can be done within the HKI Settings and changes done within the UI are instant. You could open 2 browser tabs and see the changes happen in real-time. New users will be happy to know that it will not break your existing (storage mode) lovelace dashboard and you can continue to use/experiment with it while having HKI installed. HKI will act as a second dashboard (which can be set as the default if desired).

Don't like certain elements I have created? Almost every single element can be renamed, shown or hidden and each view has a special user area. The user area works like how you'd setup any other lovelace card and will show up on the designated views. User content will rarely be touched by me and should survive most (if not all) updates without you needing to worry about it. So if you don't like my vacuum control center, but you do like HKI, well you can disable my control center and create one yourself with ease. No special programming skills required other than knowing how to create lovelace cards which is very well documented on the Home Assistant website.

Updating should be relatively easy unless a major breaking change comes from the HA team. Whenever a large update will come I will make thorough guides for you to make the update as smooth as possible.

#### Disclaimer
This project is a pretty heavy setup, I don't and never will recommend this to be used on any version of a Raspberry Pi. It will work, however your experiences may vary. To get the best out of this setup I will recommend to use at least a dual core i3 with a minimum of 4GB of RAM. I will recommend an i5 and 6GB of RAM or more to get the best performance and be able to expand your setup without worrying about RAM. I'd personally advise to use Home Assistant and not Home Assistant Core, simply because it is more userfriendly.

To answer a much asked question, this is my current used hardware/software.
- CPU: i5 4690 3,6 GHz
- RAM: 32GB DDR3 1600MHz
- MOTHERBOARD: Gigabyte H97m-D3H
- DISKS: A bunch of SSD's and HDD's
- SOFTWARE: Unraid
- HOME ASSISTANT: Home Assistant Core on Docker (Unraid)

### Questions and Support

Please ask any question you have on the [HA Community Forums](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/homekit-infused-hki-v0-13-3/117086/1)

#### Featured Theme
Dwains Theme is a beautiful theme created by @Dwains which can be found [here](https://github.com/dwainscheeren/lovelace-dwains-theme). I will recommend this theme as an alternative to HKI when you are using lighter hardware.

#### Featured Cards and Addons
One of the great things that can be done with it is shown by the following user @noodlemctwoodle which has shared his beautiful view which can be used with HKI! You can find his repo and instructions [here](https://github.com/noodlemctwoodle/homeassistant)
