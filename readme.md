# This is my personal HKI v4.x.x setup

You can use this as an example on how to create either your own views through auto-filling or create views with the custom_cards method.

This should help you with configuration since it has almost 40 views of different examples.

To view the views I have setup open `/hki-user/config/view_config.yaml`
To view how I have setup the homepage/menu/header open `/hki-user/config/general_config.yaml`

To view how I have setup my views with `custom_cards: true` you can view the code in `/hki-user/views`
