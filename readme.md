## Homekit Infused (Lovelace) by Jimz011

**WARNING:** *HKI 5 will be released within 2 months, there will be NO direct upgrade path from v4 to v5, you will however get over 200 new features that were never possible before! Stay tuned!*

This is Homekit Infused aka HKI. When you come here for the first time you might be a little confused to what this is. 
Homekit Infused is in a nutshell a customizable 'framework' that you can use to build your own dashboard on, it is preconfigured to have an Apple style to it.
By default it contains the following things:
- A beautiful header with notifications that is customizable per view and is added to each view for you automatically
- A customizable navigation bar which can also be set at the bottom of the screen 
- 11 color schemes
- A LOT of (optional) addons that can be turned on/off at will without any coding knowledge to enhance your lovelace experience
- Easy updates, copy/replace 2 folders on each update!
- And MUCH MUCH I mean MUCH more!

*Note: None of the custom-cards used in this project are made by me and every custom-card used has a reference to their original creators as well as the original link to their repo's. All contributors/donators and people that gave me the inspiration are mentioned in the docs on the last page!
