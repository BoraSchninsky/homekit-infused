If you want this to work without extra editing configuration.yaml you will have to paste the folder inside of the /configuration/ folder.
If you do not have this folder yet just create one at the root of your directory. E.g. /configuration/themes/

If you change the path to the themes please change the location inside of your configuration.yaml as well.
