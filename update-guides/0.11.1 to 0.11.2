## Update Guide from 0.11.1 to 0.11.2:
Please read this first. In all changed files there is a `# Changed/Added in 0.11.2`. Change/Add these lines in your own files. Most changes are relatively small. Find these tags in any of the files that have changed so you can easily change/add your own lines/files.
This is true for every file below. Note: If it says a file has changed but there are no comments, than it is most likely you only need to remove lines. Below you can read which lines/stacks you will need to remove.
I am only human, I do this for hobby, am an amateur and bound to make mistakes. If you find anything missing to the information below feel free to make suggestions.

#### Added
*Includes: if you use the same configuration as I do, you can just copy these files
- New includes folder
- brightness-label.yaml (this is the new brightness label, brightness now only shows when ON, the reason it is an include is to declutter the light.yaml file)
- light-device-grid.yaml (this is the new grid used for lights and devices, it will make state and label show horizontally on the same line, the reason it is an include is so you can use it elsewhere if required)

#### Changed:
*Templates: if you do not change templates I provide you can always just copy these files without the need of checking the code, Unless when there are added variables!
- Changed header-template.yaml (color is now variable, you will have to add the following line in all your themes 'header-color: white' or copy the ones from the repo)
- Changed switch-template.yaml (grid is now a template, see comments in the file they are marked with a version number. This is to make other grids possible)
- Changed mini-graph-template.yaml (hardcoded color is now removed, nothing replaces this as it will use global theme colors now)

*Views: views contain information about your own entities, do not just copy this!
- Changed lights.yaml (labels have been changed to the new format with includes, grid changed for ALL entities, use the included files in the includes folder with this)
- Changed devices.yaml (grid changed for ALL entities)
- Changed energy.yaml (graphs now have the same size and font, decimals are set to 0 and a blank card is added to the bottom for a better smartphone view)
- Changed frontpage.yaml (the security button is now back in the quick access menu when the alarm is armed, this was gone by mistake)
- Changed weather.yaml (added headers to the cards, added buienradar iframe)
- Changed postnl-jimmy/stephanie.yaml (the postnl card now has a background matching the theme set)

*Themes: if you use the same themes, just copy these.
- Changed ALL themes (added the following line: 'header-color: white')
- Changed ALL white themes (now all white themes have a white dashboard/configuration screen)

*Other: unnecessary, but might be useful for some.
- Changed all remaining decluttering cards that did not have descriptive text (added descriptive text, you don't need this in any way, it is just informative)
- Changed all decluttering cards (parameters have been renamed to variables, you don't need this in any way, it is just informative)
