# Homekit Infused Release v. 0.12.0

Hi all, today I have a great update for all of you. As promised not as fast after the previous one, though a bit larger in size. First of all, I want to announce that after months of work I have given the project a proper name. I will call it Homekit Infused (HKI in short). Continue to read up as this update is really huge.
Unfortunately I can not estimate the time needed to update to 0.12.0, but I would advise you to take at least one to three hours for this update (depending on your skillset). Skilled HA users might be able to do this faster. This update is a big one and has VERY IMPORTANT notes that you SHOULD read!! Fail to read and you will find yourself with a broken setup very soon. Many files have moved in this release and all is done with an eye on the future. Yes the updates I put on lately are pretty rough and a lot of work. But trust me if I say it is for the better as adding stuff will only get easier in time. As you know this config is easier to use/setup with each release and I could make the releases so much bigger. But I prefer you to have a slower pace so you don't have to rewrite the entire config at once. Anyways I really hope you will enjoy this new release with a completely new notifications system for the frontpage. It is now dynamic and interactive. Cool huh?
### Extra Note:
- Releases get reviewed by people that adopt my releases. I do not have the time to review all releases myself, have a full-time job and work on HA at the same time (oh and did I mention all the support I give on HA problems?). So please if you find anything missing in the update files or docs open an issue on my repo and it will be added/changed. Also note that in some cases I did not mark the changes, there are so many changes sometimes that it is better to just read my guides. Follow them and you will be fine. Thank you for your patience.

### Changes Overview 20/08/2019:
v. 0.12.0
- A completely revamped notifications system for the frontpage, now notifications are dynamic and interactive
- Fixed icloud caldav (remove your url in configuration.yaml or secrets.yaml and change it to 'https://caldav.icloud.com')
- Fixed Tile device_tracker (this fix comes from the official HA github and will be pushed into HA 0.98.x, if you can't wait just copy the custom_component into your own folders. All config will stay the same)
- Added energy-usage to some button-cards (Special thanks to @ jeroenklompen, tweakers.net, unfortunately I do not know his community/github name to properly thank him)
- Changed currently on view with a auto-entities card, no longer will you need to hardcode entities on this page. (Special thanks to @xMrVizzy for sharing the code)
- Moved/renamed files to make navigating folders more easy
- Split some of the config for the same reason as above
- A lot of style fixes
- Added some more tablet code
- Many small fixes and changes, for full changes see the update guides

## Update Guide from 0.11.2 to 0.12.0:
Please read this first. In all changed files there is a `# Changed/Added in 0.12.0` tag. Change/Add these lines in your own files. Most changes are relatively small. Find these tags in any of the files that have changed so you can easily change/add your own lines/files.
This is true for every file below. Note: If it says a file has changed but there are no comments, than it is most likely you only need to remove lines. Below you can read which lines/stacks you will need to remove.
I am only human, I do this for hobby, am an amateur and bound to make mistakes. If you find anything missing to the information below feel free to make suggestions.

#### Added
*Includes: if you use the same configuration as I do, you can just copy these files
- Added bottom-card.yaml (this is the line that replaces all the blank-cards at the bottom of the screen, replace the remaining empty button-cards which resides on some of the views/templates at the bottom with an !include to this path)

*Addons and Resources: if you use the same configuration as I do, you can just copy these files
- Added lovelace-auto-entities (install this addon with HACS, https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-auto-entities and add this to your resources)

*Folders: you can safely use the same folders as I do
- Added Notifications folder (frontpage notifications will now be in this folder)
- Added cch folder (compact custom header config is now in this folder)

*Popup-cards: remember to use your own entities, use the same entities as in the corresponding files (e.g. lights.yaml or notifications.yaml)
- Added notification-popup.yaml (options for the new interactive notifications will reside in this folder)
- Added device-popup.yaml (now the devices view will have the same more-info window style as the lights view)

*Templates: templates can be copied safely
- Added birthday-notification-template (this is to declutter the interactive and dynamic notifications on the frontpage)

*Config:
- Added compact-custom-header.yaml (this is now separated from ui-lovelace.yaml. it has the new description type in the file with all config variables. please comment on this if you like/dislike this and if you'd like to see it in more files)

#### Changed:
*Templates: if you do not change templates I provide you can always just copy these files without the need of checking the code, Unless when there are added variables!
- Changed decluttering_template.yaml (notification_card renamed to notification_template to be in line with the file name, added birthday-notification-template.yaml path to this file)
- Changed descriptive text on all template and !includes (informative only, you don't need this)
- Changed notification-template.yaml (this file is completely rewritten for the new interactive and dynamic notifications on the frontpage. you could use switch-template.yaml instead of this as well, but this would make the code twice as long)
- Moved blank-card.yaml to the includes folder (please change path to blank-card.yaml in ALL files AND folders, DO NOT MISS ONE, missing one will make it extremely hard to find it! so do the files one by one. these cards can be found EVERYWHERE, that includes the templates folder, popup-cards folder, views and notifications folder. Check ALL files and folders! IMPORTANT)
- Moved and renamed simple-weather-card-template.yaml (renamed to simple-weather-card.yaml, moved to includes folder)
- Renamed decluttering_templates.yaml to decluttering-templates.yaml (done for consistency)
- Renamed decluttering_templates folder (the folder will now just be named lovelace/templates)
- light-popup.yaml (changed light-entity to more-info-card, light popups will look roughly the same as before, but it will have the standard card as more-info window. this will set the brightness sliders lower so that they are easier to reach on a smartphone, also because of this change the history will now be shown at the top)
- mini-graph-template.yaml (added extra variables, now the default bars/line points will be smaller which looks a bit better. just copy this file over your old one, no extra config needed, all your graphs will automatically change their line/bar width)

*Views: views contain information about your own entities, do not just copy this!
- Changed security.yaml (deep_press added to all camera's. this is useful for iphones only!)
- Changed energy.yaml (tablet code added)
- Changed main-view.yaml (added pop-up cards config)
- Changed devices.yaml (fixed label on the second button of the first row, added energy label to devices that can have their power usage read)
- Changed themes.yaml (decluttering-card removed and replaced with markdown-card, this is because of the notification-template change)
- Changed vacuum.yaml (decluttering-card removed and replaced with markdown-card, this is because of the notification-template change)
- Changed devices.yaml (popup card config added to this page)
- Changed currently_on.yaml (this view now uses the new lovelace-auto-entities card, entities that were previously hardcoded will now be added automatically, use the example to include/exclude your own entities)
- Changed tala.yaml (you probably do not have this anymore, if you do, the history-graph has been removed from the config. this is still accessible by clicking on the photo/image of the person)
- Changed frontpage.yaml (path to simple-weather-card changed)
- Changed notifications.yaml (this file is completely rewritten for the new interactive and dynamic notifications on the frontpage)
- Moved notifications.yaml (notifications.yaml is now in the /lovelace/notifications folder)
- Changed main-view.yaml (change path to notifications)
- Changed ALL files (please change path to blank-card.yaml in ALL files AND folders, DO NOT MISS ONE, missing one will make it extremely hard to find it! so do the files one by one. these cards can be found EVERYWHERE, that includes the templates folder, popup-cards folder, views and notifications folder. Check ALL files and folders! IMPORTANT)

*Configuration: please do not copy these files, copy the lines you need.
- Changed ui-lovelace.yaml (compact custom header or cch is now separated from this file, config is now in the /lovelace/cch folder. path to decluttering-cards changed)
- Changed input_select.yaml (removed unused input_select entities)
- Changed input_boolean.yaml (removed unused input_boolean entities and added new ones for the notifications system)

*Popup-cards:
- Changed light-popup.yaml (added vertical-stack, horizontal-stacks and blank-cards, this is to make the popups more in line with the rest of the styling)

*Other: unnecessary, but might be useful for some.
- Undocumented change that was in 0.11.2 (Changed person-more-info.yaml, removed history-graph)
