# Homekit Infused Release v. 0.12.2

Hi all, a few small updates today, it might take you a while to do this though, but I challenge you. It took me about half an hour to do most of the changes. This update is probably another puzzling one as many things have been renamed. Why all this renaming you ask? Well when I first started uploading my setup to github I was already pretty far in with HA. I never actually thought of sharing it until people asked me to. I have since uploaded my setup to github and as expected I get a lot of questions. Most questions are actually very legit, but really dumb of myself because if I had chosen logical names it would be much easier and all of these questions would have probably been avoided, but because I was busy creating new stuff instead of beautifying old stuff I never bothered to change it. Slowly I will declutter the mess I made of many names, paths, unused automations etc. The upcoming updates will all have some renames and template changes to make the setup not only easier to use and understand for new users, but also for existing users and obviously myself. I sometimes get lost in the names and this way finding the right file will be a lot easier. In the next few updates I will clean out automations and make them smaller where possible. I will also clean out the secrets.yaml file, which I get too much questions about XD. I will take it step by step as I don't want to rebuild the entire config in a single go. This way you can shift to the new and more readable way of configuring at a slower pace. I am very sorry for the inconvenience, but hey, what would HA be without a little challenge ey?

### Changes Overview 23/08/2019:
v. 0.12.2
- Renamed most decluttering-templates and files that come with that
- Renamed all template names in EVERY file in the lovelace folder, please read the update guide for more information
- Added option for multiple entities in the mini-graph-template
- Added new feature, entities with energy readings have a new popup window with energy usage (Warning: for Tasmota Energy devices only)


## Update Guide from 0.12.1 to 0.12.2:
Please read this first. In all changed files there is a `# Changed/Added in 0.12.2` tag. Change/Add these lines in your own files. Most changes are relatively small. Find these tags in any of the files that have changed so you can easily change/add your own lines/files.
This is true for every file below. Note: If it says a file has changed but there are no comments, than it is most likely you only need to remove lines. Below you can read which lines/stacks you will need to remove.
I am only human, I do this for hobby, am an amateur and bound to make mistakes. If you find anything missing to the information below feel free to make suggestions.

#### Added
*Includes: if you use the same configuration as I do, you can just copy these files
- Added large-bottom-card.yaml (this card is added to make popup cards a bit larger at the bottom, it might get used in the future, it serves no purpose at this moment)

*Templates: templates can be copied safely
- Added energy-usage-popup-template (this is the a predefined template for Tasmota devices with the ability to do Energy readings. Apply this template to a popup card. in my example the device-popup.yaml file has 3 of these cards at the bottom of the file. if you happen to have tasmota energy devices you can probably use the exact same template. the status button which is second on the first row can be removed if you do not want this as this requires you to setup template sensors. if you don't need this you can remove this button from energy-usage-popup-template.yaml. I might make one for ESPhome devices as well when I flash mine to it. *this is a requested feature)

#### Changed:
*Templates: if you do not change templates I provide you can always just copy these files without the need of checking the code, Unless when there are added variables!
- All templates have been renamed, either the filename or the decluttering template name or both (replace ALL the template names and paths in your decluttering-templates.yaml file with the new ones and rename the files in the templates folder to the new ones)
- Changed decluttering-templates.yaml (most if not all templates have been renamed to an easier to understand format, added energy-usage-popup-template)
- Changed filenames in templates folder (all templates now have a *-template suffix, much easier to find your files this way, remember to change decluttering-templates.yaml to match the right path! IMPORTANT, you already did this if you did the steps above!)
- Changed button-template.yaml (formerly switch-button-template, this has new config at the bottom, old operators have been removed and a default has been added, this change is done because of inconsistencies with the theme on some pages e.g. vacuum.yaml)
- Changed mini-graph-template.yaml (the template has now extra options to have multiple entities available in a single graph, this breaks your existing graphs and will need reconfiguring, see climate.yaml or energy.yaml for an example on how to do that. *this is a requested feature)

*Includes: if you use the same configuration as I do, you can just copy these files
- Changed bottom-card.yaml (now it has the same pixel size as the blank-card)

*Views: views contain information about your own entities, do not just copy this!
- All views have had their decluttering cards template name changed (please open EVERY FILE you have in your lovelace folder and replace ALL the template names in your decluttering cards. Also open decluttering-templates.yaml and rename the templates/files to the new ones if you haven't done this in the step above. Every file except for most templates, cch and resources, and I mean every file has these template names. To give you an example, at the top of every view there is a decluttering card which displays the Quick Access Menu, if you have used my templates it will have the following name `back_botton`. These names are what I am talking about, another example is the `switch_button_card` which is now simply called `button`, every button in my setup uses this template so you will have to rename all of them, try not to miss one, no wait, I dare you! Because what is Home Assistant without a little challenge? Good luck)
- Changed frontpage.yaml (removed automatic alarm activation with the hold action in the Quick Access Menu, this would sometimes trigger when using with swipe-card. notification cards do the same thing and if set up correctly, pressing any of those cards will give you a popup window to arm/disarm the alarm)
- Changed climate.yaml (decluttering-card config for the mini-graph has changed, it can now accept more entities, please see the comments on how to do this, if you have other views with graphs you will need to do it there as well)
- Changed energy.yaml (decluttering-card config for the mini-graph has changed, it can now accept more entities, please see the comments on how to do this, if you have other views with graphs you will need to do it there as well)

*Configuration: please do not copy these files, copy the lines you need.
- Changed sensor.yaml (renamed ALL dishwasher/washingmachine/dishwasher to Dutch names, this is done for the tasmota template, this is not a necessity!)
- Changed automations.yaml (made alarmcode a secret in all alarm automations with a code, renamed ALL dishwasher/washingmachine/dishwasher to Dutch names, this is done for the tasmota template, this is not a necessity!)
- Changed input_select.yaml (renamed ALL dishwasher/washingmachine/dishwasher to Dutch names, this is done for the tasmota template, this is not a necessity!)

*Notifications: don't copy mine, but compare and use what you need
- Changed notifications.yaml (washing-machine, dryer and dishwasher have all been renamed to Dutch in all conditional cards that contained them, this makes templating easier for me, you only need to do this if you have changed the files in the configuration steps above, you probably won't need this)

*Popup-cards:
- Changed notification-popup.yaml (popup windows that have buttons to arm/disarm the alarm now use an automation as trigger as the button-card does not accept the required extra keys to make this work, secrets have been removed)
